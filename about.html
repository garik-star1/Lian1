                        At Website.com, we believe everyone deserves to have a <br>
                        website or online store. Innovation and simplicity makes us <br>
                        happy: our goal is to remove any technical or financial barriers <br>
                        that can prevent business owners from making their own <br> 
                        website. We're excited to help you on your journey!

                        Website.com began in 2005. After years in the web hosting industry, <br> we realized that it was near impossible for the average Jane or Joe to create <br>their own website. Traditional web hosting services were simply too <br>complicated, time consuming, and expensive to manage.

                        We created the Website.com Site Builder with the user's perspective in <br>mind. We wanted to offer a platform that would require no coding skills or <br>design experience. We keep it simple, so users can focus on creating an<br> amazing website that reflects their brand. Best of all - it's free. You can<br> get online, showcase your brand, or start selling products right away.

                        After seeing an increased need for ecommerce solutions, we developed<br> one of the only fully-featured, free and commission-free online store <br>builders, allowing business owners to launch their online business.
